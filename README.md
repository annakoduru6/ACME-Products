# ACME-Products
The intent for this school assignment was to test my coding skills and demonstrate competency in writing my own Python modules, object-oriented programming, code style, and testing.

This was a "mock" situation as an employee of Acme Corporation looking for ways to better organize the vast quantities and variety of goods the company manages and sells.
